# A Representation of Euler's Sieve

## Description
Euler's sieve is an algorithm that is almost identical to Aristhosthenes' Sieve. THe only difference is that Euler's sieve does not mark a number again.

## Motivation
I just felt curious what will happen and how it would look like. 

I'm also a fan of odd wallpapers, especially if they're generated using a mathematical concepts.
