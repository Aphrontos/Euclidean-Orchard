# A Representation of Euler's Sieve

## Description
Euler's sieve is an algorithm that marks composite numbers only once.

## Motivation
I just felt curious what will happen and how it would look like. 

I'm also a fan of odd wallpapers, especially if they're generated using a mathematical concepts.
