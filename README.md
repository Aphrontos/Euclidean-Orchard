# A Representation of Euler's Sieve

## Description
Euler's sieve is an algorithm that marks composite numbers only once. This program generates a representation of the alogrithm. The x-axis represent the integer number line, while the y-axis represent the passes the algorithm takes as dictated by the primes. 

## Legend

* \#47EF91
  
  The algorithm marks that number at that pass
* \#184646
  
  The algorithm has not
* \#FF0000
  
  The primes
  
## Motivation
I just felt curious what will happen and how it would look like. 

I'm also a fan of odd wallpapers, especially if they're generated using a mathematical concepts.
